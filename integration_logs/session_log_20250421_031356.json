        "response": "Here's why the sky is blue:\n\n\u2022 **Scattering**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen.\n\u2022 **Short wavelengths**: These molecules scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n\u2022 **Blue dominance**: As a result, our eyes see the scattered blue light, making the sky appear blue.",
